Some of my projects that I developed in order to improve my scripting skills or just for fun.
- prisoncells.rbxl
Makes the doors slide from open to close and close to open using TweenService. Also changes the color of blocks from green to red and red to green when the cells are closed and opened. Something I made to test my knowledge and ability with TweenService. Can definitely be optimized but I made it using only the knowledge I had up until that moment.
This file includes 1 Script inside ServerScriptService, 5 prison cells inside of Workspace, 5 "lights" inside of Workspace and 1 button with a ClickDetector inside of Workspace.

- improved_prisoncells.rbxl
Serves the same purpose as the first file but this one is a lot more optimized. Half the amount of code with each door organized inside a folder. I also used Attributes in order to tell if the doors are open or closed, instead of using a local variable. Used TweenService.
