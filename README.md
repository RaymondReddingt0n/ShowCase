# ShowCase
Some of my projects that I developed in order to improve my scripting skills or just for fun.
- prisoncells.rbxl
Makes the doors slide from open to close and close to open using TweenService. Also changes the color of blocks from green to red and red to green when the cells are closed and opened. Something I made to test my knowledge and ability with TweenService. Can definitely be optimized but I made it using only the knowledge I had up until that moment.
This file includes 1 Script inside ServerScriptService, 5 prison cells inside Workspace and 5 lights inside Workspace.
